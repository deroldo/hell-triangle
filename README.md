## Hell Triangle - Challenge
Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom.

Example:
```
   6
  3 5
 9 7 1
4 6 8 4 
```

In this triangle the maximum total is 6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26

An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row
So the element 3 in row 2 can be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1
